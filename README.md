# HAWK - HTTP/S Analysis Web Kit ðŸ¦…

## Overview
HAWK (HTTP/S Analysis Web Kit) is a powerful network analysis tool designed for security researchers, penetration testers, and developers who need deep insights into network traffic. It provides functionalities similar to Wireshark while offering additional proxy capabilities for traffic manipulation similar to Burp Suite or Fiddler 4.

## Features
- **Packet Viewer**: Analyze network packets in real-time, similar to Wireshark.

- **Universal Proxy**: Proxy any port and manipulate traffic by editing, forwarding, or blocking requests.

- **Advanced HTTPS Proxying**: Intercept, view, and modify non encrypted HTTPS traffic.
